1,2,0,1,I was in the kitchen preparing dinner when I heard a loud thud from the living room. When I rushed in I saw the victim lying there. I did not see anyone else at the time.
2,2,0,1,I was sitting on the chair watching videos on my phone at the time. I did not see anyone suspicious but I did for a brief moment notice (KitchenPerson0) leaving the kitchen in a hurry just before the noise.
3,2,0,1,I was dusting the shelves in the hallway. I did not see the incident but I did hear someone moving quickly upstairs.
4,2,0,1,I was outside daydreaming when I heard the scream. When I came inside everyone was already gathered around the body. It was only then when I screamed out of horror and disgust.
1,1,0,1,I was in the living room reading a book. I did not hear anything unusual until the scream.
2,1,0,1,I was sitting on the couch working on my laptop. I did not see anything but I noticed (LivingRoomPerson0) pacing back and forth before the scream. She seemed agitated in my opinion.
3,1,0,1,I was in the corner organizing some boxes going back and forth across the room. I did not see or hear much until the commotion.
4,1,0,1,I was here in the living room. I thought I heard footsteps outside but I did not think much of it.
1,3,0,1,I was in the hallway fixing a loose picture frame. I did not hear or see anything until someone shouted for help.
2,3,0,1,I was in the hallway scrolling through my phone. I did not notice anything unusual until the scream.
3,3,0,1,I was in the hallway checking on the closet. I did not hear or see anyone.
4,3,0,1,I was in the hallway tidying up. I saw (HallwayPerson1) on his phone and nothing else until the scream.
1,2,1,2,That is a kitchen knife! It is from the set we keep in the drawer. I last saw it in the kitchen before the commotion. You should ask (KitchenPerson2) whom I was with in the kitchen earlier.
2,2,1,2,That is definitely one of ours. I do not know who used it but I saw (KitchenPerson0) chopping vegetables with it earlier.
3,2,1,2,I am sorry I do not know much about that. I can not even cook. It is from the kitchen right? You should ask someone.
4,2,1,2,That is not something I would know about. I was not even aware of what happened. I was completely shocked. Maybe someone else saw something.
1,1,2,4,This is the victims notebook. They were always jotting things down in it. You might want to check if anything looks suspicious.
2,1,2,4,The victim was always protective of that notebook. Strangely enough I always saw Steve try to take a sneak peak at that notebook. That always annoyed the victim. It is almost as if it is a hobby of his.
3,1,2,4,I have no idea. I have never seen it before. Maybe ask (LivingRoomPerson0) or (LivingRoomPerson1); they knew the victim better than me.
4,1,2,4,That is the victimâ€™s handwriting and someone elses writing. I can not help you much with this.
1,3,3,7,I do not know whose phone is that.
2,3,3,7,I know I have seen that phone somewhere. I remember (HallwayPerson0) having a phone that looks similar.
3,3,3,7,No idea who this phone belongs to. I only know about my phone. I always keep that on me.
4,3,3,7,That phone looks familiar. This is not my phone but it does look familiar.
